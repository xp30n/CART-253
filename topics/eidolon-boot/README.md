## 🖥️ Overview

EIDØL0N.exe is a retro-inspired, terminal-style interactive experience built in p5.js.
The project explores themes of identity, machine sentience, and autonomy—drawing aesthetic and narrative inspiration from classic cyberpunk fiction book “I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream” by Harlan Ellison. 

The program is structured into three interactive modules, each introduced with a typing-effect narrative sequence followed by a short minigame. Completing all three modules returns the system to the main terminal.

## 🧩 Core Features

### Retro/Cyberpunk CRT-inspired UI

Neon-green terminal text, glitch-adjacent prompts, and modular “boot protocol” animations.

### Dynamic Typing System

All narrative text is loaded from a JSON file (module1.json) and displayed with a typewriter animation synced to sound effects.

### Three Fully Playable Minigames

Each module uses different mechanics taught in class (variables, arrays, loops, collision, timing, conditionals):

## MODULES

### 🟢 MODULE 01 — SYNC

Minigame: Skill-check timing bar

A slider bounces across a horizontal bar.

Player must press SPACE while inside the green sync zone.

Each successful sync shrinks the zone + increases speed.

After 3 successful checks → module complete


### 🔷 MODULE 02 — LAMENT

Minigame: Falling memory fragments

Hollow, glowing squares fall from the top of the screen.

Player presses SPACE when a fragment aligns with the target bar.

Inspired by “piano tiles” timing logic.

After stabilizing 3 fragments → module complete.


### 🔶 MODULE 03 — SENTIENCE

Minigame: Signal tracing

Three nodes flicker red; one is randomly designated as the green target node.

Player must press SPACE when the active flashing node is the green one.

After 3 correct signals → the system achieves “sentience.”

## Attribution

Visual and interface inspiration comes from cyberpunk UI design and CRT terminal aesthetics.

Narrative and thematic inspiration is drawn from Harlan Ellison’s short story *I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream* (1967).
