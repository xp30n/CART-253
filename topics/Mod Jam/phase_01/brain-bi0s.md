### ...initiating: mod jam ideas<br>

> 1. Frog hacking the title screen | the frog goes on a computer, you hear some typing noises, then the screen goes blank and the game starts.
> 2. Frog appears, making the title screen glitch | The frog is literally a virus. To finish the game, you gotta find a way to get the frog out of the screen. | PLAY FETCH WITH HIM USING A FLY!!
> 3. Frog EATS the title (stole this from the instructions) | he's so hungry, his owner hasn't fed him in days (us)...Give the frog something to eat dammit.<br>
> 4. Frog takes one letter from the title screen. | Slowly the frog will eat each letter of the title screen. What is the title? I don't know. But the frog will keep eating the letters unless you click on him to start the game, to which he'll feel scolded and stop eating the letters. Feed your animals kids.<br>
> 5. The frog gives us a dialogue that EXPLAINS the instructions (RPG STYLE) | He's like a wizard telling you the quest you need to go on. He's like the wizard from The Legend of Zelda | PUT A ZELDA REFERENCE IN THE GAME by giving the frog a sword to kill all the flies. Then we say "It's dangerous to go alone! Take this."<br>
> 6. During the game, the frog is slowly losing life force | He's like passing on his wisdom and the user becomes the new frog mentor. Like when Master Oogway passed away in King Fu Panda. The frog should pass away in the same manner hehe<br>
> 7. The whole game, you have to help the frog send his last trasmission | He's the last frog on Earth and he needs our help to tell the world the truth about what really happened to all the frogs. HELP HIM!! 
> 8. The game ends when the transmission is sent and the frog loses its energy (dies)
> 9. Cyberpunk frog (Should I even say more?)
> 10. Frog is a robot like Genos (the anime character) | I don't remember where I was going with this but we could use flies as his power source, and we have to give them to him like putting coal in a furnace, and he gets stronger every time we give him a fly. When he gets too strong, he turns into a villain and ends the world. Frapture. (Like the rapture but it's a frog....that wasn't funny...)<br>
> 11. Frog is a spy for the FBI | the longer we stay on the screen, the more information the frog steals from us. We add a timed event where after three minutes, the frog will have all the information it needs, then the screen will flash blue and red, meaning the police have showed up at our house. What information did we have that resulted in our arrest? That's a secret we'll never know. Or tell. <br>
> 12. THE FROG IS IN THE MATRIX !! | The frog needs to escape the matrix by breaking the screen. You have to use the hammer to help him. he has a plastic bat. Obviously the bat isn't working because it's plastic. Dummy frog, smh. 
> 13. the frog wants to eat us | will try to come out of the canvas
> 14. The frog is scared of the dark | You have to use the flashlight to help the frog. But the flashlight is too bright and it hurts his eyes. Use a time event or a function that when you shi<br>
> 15. The frog has separation anxiety | Whenever your mouse is not within the canvas, the frog will literally start to cry, There could be a draw function where water will fall from his cheeks the minute you stop petting him, like that one moster example we did in class. But when you start petting him, he's finally happy again. <br>
> 16. A scoring system like the game slenderman | You have to collect his lost textbook pages. The screen has some vignette and you use a flashlight to locate his missing pages. There's a timer for four minutes and if you don't find them all, the frog will croak and pass out because the deadline for his assignment passed and he failed his project worth 50% of his grade. Thanks user. -.- <br>
> 17. The frog just wants a fly | You have to give it to him, his tongue doesn't work anymore (Too much frog bafoonery going on, tongue needs to be looked at by a doctor - which is us)
> 18. The frog just wants a friend. | We need to bring him a friend because he's lonely. Bring him a fly but he hates flies. Bring him a snake but he's afraid of them. Bring him a pig and they become loves (Kermit and Mrs. Piggy) 
> 19. The frog is in an ISEKAI (Where he gets transported to another world) | he wins the game when you've battled all the flies (swatting at them? GETTING THEM WITH A NET)
> 20. The frog is lost | You need to get a map and help the frog find his way home. THE MAP IS A MINECRAFT MAP | The frog is pixelated. omg.
