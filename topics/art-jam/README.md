## Booting Persona.exe...Access Granted ⚠

> Welcome to the self portrait that hides as much as it reveals, starring back from behind the code.

> Persona.exe is my self-portrait as a digital alter ego, recreated with p5.js. The mask conceals, the eyes reveal, and the code brings it all together.

## Screenshots 🛸

> Here are a few screenshots and images of the concept art I made!
